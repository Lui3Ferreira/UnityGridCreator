# easyGrid
A tool that allows easy creation and configuration of grids in a 3D space.

The grid generator allows grids by 20x20. If you need a bigger grid, you just need to do the following:
1-Open the GridGenerator.unity file.
2-Click the Main Camera
3-The Main Camera has a Grid Manager script. You just need to increase the "MyGameItems" list to as many Game Objects as you want!
4- That's it!
