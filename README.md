# easyGrid
"easyGrid" is a tool that allows the easy creation and configuration of grids in a 3D space. The user can create various grid configurations to be later used in different game-like contexts. The software was developed in Unity 2020.2.3f1 (64-bit).

If you are creating more extensive grids, but there are not enough game objects to visualize the results, you need to do the following:
1-Open the GridGenerator.unity file.
2-Click the Main Camera
3-The Main Camera has a Grid Manager script. You just need to increase the "MyGameItems" list to as many Game Objects as you want!
4- That's it!
